# 📊 LeetCode Problem: House Robber

## 🧩 Problem Statement

You are a professional **robber** planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain **amount of money** stashed, the only **constraint** stopping you from robbing each of them is that **adjacent houses** have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the **maximum amount** of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

> **Note :**
> - Use Dynamic programing top-down approach - Recursion + memoization



## 🧠 Approach: Recursion + Memoization

> Base Case:
> - If `i >= size of array` -> return `0` (no houses left).

> Choices:
> - **Skip** current house -> move to index `i+1`.
> - **Rob** current house -> add its value + move to index `i+2`.

> Recurrence Relation:
> - `dp[i] = max(skip, rob)`

> Memoization:
> - Initialize a dp array with `-1`.
> - Store results for **every index** to avoid recomputation.

## ✅ Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

##### Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
##### Output: 4

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
- Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
  
</pre>

### Example 2

##### Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
##### Output: 12

##### Explanation: 
<pre> 
- Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
- Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
  
</pre>



## 🛠️ Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`
